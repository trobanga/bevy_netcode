# Bevy Netcode

This crate aims to add a network layer around bevy_ggrs that establishes a connection via webrtc using webrtc-rs.

## Goals

- Users should be able to connect and disconnect during runtime
- Cross-platform connections, it shouldn't matter whether you run the game in a browser or standalone
-
